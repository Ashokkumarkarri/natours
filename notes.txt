understaind how middelwear works.

---------------------
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Hello from the middleware');
  next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.requestTime = new Date().toISOString();
  next();
});
----------------------

Middleware in Node.js are functions that process requests before they reach your routes. They can modify the request (req) or response (res), or execute code like logging. Middleware functions use next() to move to the next function in the stack.

For example:

The first middleware logs a message for every request.
The second middleware adds a timestamp to the request.
This helps in handling tasks like logging, authentication, and modifying data consistently across your application.
