if we have some static files in our project directory: that are not being used by routes and if we want to see them with the browser.
example: we have some images or html code in a public folder in our project directory.

and we want to see them through the browser:
we can add this middleware 
app.use(express.static(`${__dirname}/public`));
we will menction the file path.
Now if we visit http://127.0.0.3:3000/overview.html, our homepage will appear.
our public folder will act as root folder here.

so we should directly write: http://localhost:3000/overview.html
we should not write like this: http://localhost:3000/public/overview.html
