created new server.js file
why: it's good practise that we keep all the express files in one file and server related files in another file.

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App runing on ${port}....`);
});


we need to export the app from app.js

later on we will have other stuff which is not realted to express but still realted to our application, stuff like: DB configuration or some error handeling stuff or ENV varibles all of the stuff will live in this server.js file.

from now we need to do nodemon server.js
or we can create a "npm script" which will work by hitting "npm start"

-------------------------
npm script:

in package.json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon server.js"
  }

  now we need not to remeber how to run srver like is it app.js or index.js.
  when we hit npm start : the server will start.
