agenda: need to create a script using which we can 
        1.delete the existing data in mongoDB server.
        2. and also we can import the data from txt file to mongoDB.


 process.argv:
    using this we can intract with command link, whatever user will write in terminal or commandline we can have acess to it.
    process.argv is an array in Node.js that contains the command-line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched. The first two elements are:
            1.The path to the Node.js executable.
            2.The path to the JavaScript file being executed.

        Example:
                the script we are going to wrtie in this project: to delete the previous data and import new data. we will write in this file path. (dev-data\data\import-dev-data.js)
                so when we run the script by doing this: node .\dev-data\data\import-dev-data.js
                since we are console.log(process.argv): this will give a array with 2 elements.
                while we running the command, what ever we will add to in the termial will be acessed as a 3rd element in the array. (process.argv)
                ex: node .\dev-data\data\import-dev-data.js --import
                so in that array the --import will be the last 3 rd elemetn in the array.


process.exit(); //this method will forcefull stop the process

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
created a new file in dev-data/data/
new file_name : import-dev-data.js

we gare going to read a file in dev-data/data/tours-simple.json
we are going to delte all the files in mongoDB.
and update the mongoDB with the new data we had read form the file,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const fs = require('fs');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
const Tour = require('./../../models/tourModel');

dotenv.config({ path: './config.env' });

const DB = process.env.DATABASE.replace(
  '<db_password>',
  process.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD,
);

mongoose.connect(DB).then(() => {
  console.log('DB connection successful');
});

//reading JSON file
const tours = JSON.parse(
  fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/tours-simple.json`, 'utf-8'),
);

//Import data into DB
const importData = async () => {
  try {
    await Tour.create(tours);
    console.log('Data successfully loaded');
    process.exit();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
};

//Delete all Data from collection
const deleteData = async () => {
  try {
    await Tour.deleteMany();
    console.log('Data successfully Deleted');
    process.exit(); //this method will forcefull stop the process
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
};

if (process.argv[2] === '--import') {
  importData();
} else if (process.argv[2] === '--delete') {
  deleteData();
}

console.log(process.argv);
