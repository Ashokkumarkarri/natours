Implementing sorting:

    //2) Sorting
    if (req.query.sort) {
      // query = query.sort(req.query.sort);
      // //sort('price ratingsAverage')
      const sortBy = req.query.sort.split(',').join(' ');
      console.log(sortBy);
      query = query.sort(sortBy);
      //sort('price ratingsAverage')
    } else {
      query = query.sort('-createdAt');
    }

--------------------------------------

previousely we had excluded the sorting.
now we goona add sorting.
in postMan: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tours?sort=-price,-ratingsAverage
            - indicates decending order.

in mongoose we have this method called sort, the sort takes the arguments along with space. example: query.sort(price ratingsAverage)
but from postman or with url we can not send space, for than I am sending it along with coma: ?sort=-price,-ratingsAverage
