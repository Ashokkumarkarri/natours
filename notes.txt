everthing that is not related to express we wrtie it in outisde of the  app.js

app.js we use only to configure the express.


the enviroment varibles are part of node js.
so goona write in server.js 
----------------------------------------
to check in which env we are in :
console.log(app.get('env'));

this env sets by express but the node js itself sets a lot of env.


console.log(process.env);

to set development to develop through termianl for windows:
 $env:NODE_ENV="development"; nodemon server.js

we can difine multiple varibles throught terminal : $env:NODE_ENV="development"; nodemon server.js x=10

but it's not so pratical, imagine we need to put 15 or more varibles, so we do that in configuration file called : config.env
-----
 In the config.envfile 

 NODE_ENV="development";
 PORT=3000
 USER=jonas
 PASSWORD:12345

---------------

after creating the config.env file we need to read that file to out project.
for that we have a module called :npm i dotenv


-----------------------------------

Install cross-env:
npm install cross-env --save-dev

  "scripts": {
    "start:dev": "nodemon server.js",
    "start:prod": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production nodemon server.js"
  },

------------------------
in app.js
//implemented the logic for morgan logger will only work when we are in development.
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  app.use(morgan('dev'));
}

--------------
once we deployed oour project we should change ENV to production.
