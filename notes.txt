created models folder >> created tourModel.js

from server.js we had removed the tourSchema code and pasted to tourModel.

const tourSchema = new mongoose.Schema({});
const Tour = mongoose.model('Tour', tourSchema);


deleted: testTOur in server.js
exported the Tour from TOurModel and imported in tourConroller.


in tour Controller, we had removed this line.
// const tours = JSON.parse(
//   fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/../dev-data/data/tours-simple.json`)
// );

in tourController.js we had removed the tours which depends on local json dummy databas, since we goona use real mongoDB from now.
deleted all the code which depends on the localDB.

removed fs module,check ID function.

in tourROutes.js : we had commented this code: // router.param('id', tourController.checkID);
since its depending on checkID fun which has been removed in tourController.
