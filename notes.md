Sure, here are the notes for the provided code:

```js
// Create a compound index on the 'tour' and 'user' fields
// This ensures that the combination of 'tour' and 'user' is unique
// Prevents a user from writing more than one review for the same tour
reviewSchema.index({ tour: 1, user: 1 }, { unique: true });
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Compound Index**:
   - The code creates a compound index on the tour and user fields of the reviewSchema.
   - A compound index is an index on multiple fields. In this case, it is on the tour and user fields.
2. **Uniqueness**:
   - The `{ unique: true }` option ensures that the combination of tour and user is unique.
   - This means that a user can only write one review for a specific tour. If a user tries to write another review for the same tour, it will result in a duplicate key error.
3. **Index Creation**:
   - Mongoose will create this index in the MongoDB collection when the application starts.
   - If there are existing duplicate entries in the collection, the index creation will fail until the duplicates are resolved.

### **Usage:**

- This index is useful for preventing duplicate reviews by the same user for the same tour.
- It helps maintain data integrity and ensures that each user can only provide one review per tour.
